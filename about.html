<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sampson Urom. I'm a business man, entrereneur, web developer, an opportunist and a strategist. </p>

<p>I studied busniess back in higher institution. I've also practiced pharmacology from a very tender age, since I was born into the business.
  aside studying business and practicing pharmacology I've always had a strong passion for business and the urge to make so much money have kept me on my toes
  for the longest I could remember. a hobby that I would never fail to mention is "coding" and solving tech problems. my love for tech have 
  led to increase in my curiosity for the "why" and the "how" of tech.
</p>

<p>while i desire to live my best life here while doing the things that i love, I also wish to make significant changes to the world around me by using what i have 
  to achieve what i want . </p>
